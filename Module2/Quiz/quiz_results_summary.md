   - Understanding Euclidean Distance as L2 distance
   - Understanding Manhattan Distance as L1 distance

**2. Manhattan Distance (L1) Applications**
   - Business use cases for Manhattan distance
   - Applications in high-dimensional data scenarios
   - Understanding when L1 is preferred over L2

**3. Cosine Distance Properties**
   - Key features of Cosine Distance
   - Angular relationships between vectors
   - Applications in text analysis and location-independent comparisons

**4. Distance Metric Selection**
   - Choosing appropriate metrics for specific data types
   - Text document similarity measurement
   - Understanding Jaccard Distance for set-based comparisons

### Question-by-Question Breakdown

**Question 1:** What is the other name we can give to the L2 distance?
- **Your Answer:** Euclidean Distance ✓
- **Explanation:** The L2 distance is also known as Euclidean Distance, which measures straight-line distance between two points.

**Question 2:** Which of the following statements is a business case for the use of the Manhattan distance (L1)?
- **Your Answer:** We use it in business cases where there is very high dimensionality ✓
- **Explanation:** High dimensionality often leads to difficulty in distinguishing distances. The L1 score effectively distinguishes different distances when moving into higher dimensional spaces.

**Question 3:** What is the key feature for the Cosine Distance?
- **Your Answer:** The Cosine Distance, which takes into account the angle between 2 points ✓
- **Explanation:** This metric provides the cosine of the angle between vectors, defined by each point.

**Question 4:** The following statement is an example of a business case where we can use the Cosine Distance?
- **Your Answer:** Cosine is better for data such as text where location of occurrence is less important ✓
- **Explanation:** Cosine distance focuses on the angular relationship rather than magnitude, making it ideal for text and document comparisons.

**Question 5:** Which distance metric is useful when we have text documents and we want to group similar topics together?
- **Your Answer:** Jaccard ✓
- **Explanation:** Jaccard Distance is particularly useful for text documents and topic grouping as it measures similarity between sets.

## Quiz 2: Ungraded Distance Metrics Quiz

### Topics Covered

This ungraded quiz reinforced understanding of distance metrics with focus on:

**1. Distance Metric Terminology**
   - L1 distance alternative naming conventions
   - Relationship between Manhattan and L1 distance

**2. Jaccard Distance Characteristics**
   - Key features and properties
   - Set-based similarity measurements
   - Understanding intersection calculations between sets

**3. Comparative Analysis of Distance Metrics**
   - Advantages of L1 over L2 distance
   - Performance in high-dimensional spaces
   - When to choose one metric over another

### Question-by-Question Breakdown

**Question 1:** What is the other name we can give to the L1 distance?
- **Your Answer:** Manhattan Distance ✓
- **Explanation:** The L1 distance is also known as Manhattan Distance, measuring distance along axes at right angles.

**Question 2:** What is the key feature for the Jaccard Distance?
- **Your Answer:** It looks at the difference and similarities for sets of values ✓
- **Explanation:** Jaccard Distance is calculated by finding the intersection between two sets, making it ideal for comparing set-based data.

**Question 3:** What is an advantage of the L1 distance over L2?
- **Your Answer:** It can better handle high dimensional data ✓
- **Explanation:** L1 distance is better able to distinguish different distances in high-dimensional spaces because it will always be larger than L2 score, providing clearer differentiation.
